                Everyone's using AI to delegate. But the magic that makes customers choose you isn't delegatable.
                It's irreplaceable.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI has turned development into a rat race - everyone's building 10x faster. But winning was never
                about feature parity. While others automate the mundane, we amplify the exceptional. Your taste.
                Your judgment. Your specific genius. Because when everyone can build anything, the only competitive
                advantage is building what only you could build.
