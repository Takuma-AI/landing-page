                When you're in the room, deals close. When you're not, they stall.
                The gap isn't features. It's the thousands of micro-decisions you make intuitively.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI changes everything. Software can now embody deeper, more nuanced judgment than ever before.
                But most teams use AI to cut costs, not capture what makes them unique.
