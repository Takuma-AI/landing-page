## Post-Meeting Follow-up Template

```
Subject: Re: {the_gap}

{name},

Thanks for walking me through how you operate vs how your product operates.

Here's what stood out:
[Specific pattern about their judgment/taste that isn't in their product]

Based on what we discussed, here are two paths forward:
1. [Specific tactical thing they could try immediately]
2. [Larger strategic shift that would address root cause]

If you want to explore working together on encoding your approach into product, let me know.
Otherwise, I hope this gives you clarity on next steps.

Kate
