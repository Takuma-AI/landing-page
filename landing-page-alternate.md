### Scale what only you can do.

We encode your irreplaceable judgment into AI experiences that transform how you serve customers. Whether enhancing your existing product or creating new touchpoints—we build living software with the nuance and taste that usually requires your personal touch.

## The Opportunity

### Your customers pay for your judgment. Your product doesn't deliver it yet.

You know the difference: when you're in the room, deals close. When you're not, they stall. Your product works, but it doesn't work like you do.

This gap isn't about features or automation. It's about the thousands of micro-decisions you make intuitively—the taste, judgment, and context that bring your product to life.

Traditional development shops build what you tell them to. But you can't spec out intuition. You need partners who understand how to create AI products with soul—experiences that feel human, not mechanical.

## What We Do

### Foundation Sprint: Transform how your business delivers value in 4 weeks.

We start where others can't: understanding what makes your approach unique. Through intensive collaboration, we create AI-powered experiences that scale your judgment across every customer touchpoint.

**Week 1-2: Decode Your Magic**
We observe how you work, not just what you say you do. We identify the invisible patterns in your judgment that create value.

**Week 3-4: Ship the Transformation**
We build and deploy AI experiences that embody your approach. Could be enhancing your existing product, creating a new touchpoint, or building an entirely different way to serve customers. We ship what scales your impact most.

**What You Get:**
- **AI transformation in production** - New capabilities that feel like you at your best, live and usable
- **Complete source code & prompts** - Clean code with versioned, editable prompt architectures, documented for founders not just engineers
- **Integration strategy** - How this enhances or complements what you already have
- **Full ownership** - Everything we build is yours: code, prompts, infrastructure, AI patterns

**Investment:** $10,000
**Timeline:** 4 weeks
**Best For:** Founders who need to scale their judgment across more customers

## Strategic Guidance

### Your product thinking partner, on-demand.

Sometimes you don't need a full sprint. You need someone who gets both AI possibilities and product realities. Someone who's built in this space and understands the unique challenges.

**How We Help:**
- Product strategy reviews when you're at a crossroads
- AI integration patterns that maintain quality
- Design reviews that catch what others miss
- Post-sprint guidance as you build

**Investment:** $300/hour
**Structure:** Flexible, as-needed
**Best For:** Teams that have momentum but need strategic clarity

## Who This Is For

### You know something others don't. We help you scale it.

**This resonates if:**
- Customers say things work differently (better) when you're involved
- You have a product that works, but it doesn't capture what you do best
- You're tired of AI that feels sloppy—nothing you've tried matches your quality bar
- You want to transform how you deliver value, not just add features

**We're not the right fit if:**
- You have a proven playbook and just need more agents executing it at scale
- Your process is fully defined—you need cogs in the machine, not product transformation
- You're optimizing for cost and speed over quality and differentiation
- Your competitive advantage is operational efficiency, not unique judgment


## Let's Talk

### If this resonates, we should have a conversation.

30 minutes. Free. No pitch.

Come ready to talk about what happens when you're in the room vs when you're not. Leave with concrete ideas for encoding your approach into product—whether we work together or not.
