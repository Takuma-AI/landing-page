        <ul class="timeline-list">
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> We study your best deals. What made them close? What do you ask in discovery that others skip? Where does your intuition override the template?</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> We build qualification logic that thinks like you. Not scoring rubrics—actual pattern matching on what signals readiness to buy.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> We design outreach that sounds like you on your best day. The research depth, the specific questions, the way you establish credibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> You test with real leads. We watch how it performs and tune until it wins through quality, not volume.</li>

        <ul class="timeline-list">
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> We map your onboarding. Where do users actually get stuck? What questions surface when they're confused? What makes the difference between activation and churn?</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> We design guidance that feels like your support. Not help docs—actual interventions at the moments that matter, in your voice.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> We wire up contextual intelligence. It watches usage patterns, anticipates struggles, surfaces relevant help before frustration sets in.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> You test with real users. We watch the interactions and refine until every customer feels like they have you.</li>

        <ul class="timeline-list">
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> We explore the idea with you. What's the core insight others are missing? What's the trap you need to avoid? What would make this unmistakably yours?</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> We prototype the unique approach. Not the obvious AI play—the specific angle that leverages what you know that others don't.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> We build the minimum that proves it. Enough to validate the core assumption, refined enough to show the real potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> You test in real scenarios. We watch what works and what doesn't, then hand you a foundation to build on.</li>
