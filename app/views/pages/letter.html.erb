    <p class="letter-greeting">Hey there,</p>

    <p class="letter-para letter-opening">
      Code is becoming commodity. Your mojo isn't.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      What if you could go the extra mile for every customer? In four weeks, we'll capture how you work at your best and build an agent that scales it.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para letter-intro">Here's what that might look like:</p>

    <!-- Stacked Timeline Cards -->
    <div class="timeline-card-container">
      <!-- Sales Card -->
      <div class="timeline-card active" data-timeline="sales">
        <h3 class="timeline-card-title">SALES</h3>
        <p class="timeline-context">How would you show up if you had infinite time to prepare for each lead?</p>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 1</span>
          <p>We study your best deals. What made them close? What do you ask in discovery that others skip? Where does your intuition override the template?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 2</span>
          <p>We build qualification logic that thinks like you. Not scoring rubrics—actual pattern matching on what signals readiness to buy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 3</span>
          <p>We design outreach that sounds like you on your best day. The research depth, the specific questions, the way you establish credibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 4</span>
          <p>You test with real leads. We watch how it performs and tune until it wins through quality, not volume.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Product Card -->

        <p class="timeline-context">You can't hold every customer's hand forever. But your AI could.</p>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 1</span>
          <p>We map your onboarding. Where do users actually get stuck? What questions surface when they're confused? What makes the difference between activation and churn?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 2</span>
          <p>We design guidance that feels like your support. Not help docs—actual interventions at the moments that matter, in your voice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 3</span>
          <p>We wire up contextual intelligence. It watches usage patterns, anticipates struggles, surfaces relevant help before frustration sets in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 4</span>
          <p>You test with real users. We watch the interactions and refine until every customer feels like they have you.</p>

        <p class="timeline-context">AI has given you more ideas than you know what to do with. How will you build it in a way only you could?</p>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 1</span>
          <p>We explore the idea with you. What's the core insight others are missing? What's the trap you need to avoid? What would make this unmistakably yours?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 2</span>
          <p>We prototype the unique approach. Not the obvious AI play—the specific angle that leverages what you know that others don't.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 3</span>
          <p>We build the minimum that proves it. Enough to validate the core assumption, refined enough to show the real potential.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-week">
          <span class="week-label">Week 4</span>
          <p>You test in real scenarios. We watch what works and what doesn't, then hand you a foundation to build on.</p>
