      You've probably noticed: the coding part is getting easier. What used to take a weekend now takes an afternoon. What used to require a team might just need you and Claude.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      But here's what AI can't do: figure out <em>what</em> to build. Know when a client's request would actually hurt them. Recognize the moment someone's ready to pay more. Feel when a feature would complicate instead of clarify.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      That instinct you have? That's not automatable. It's the thing that makes your work yours.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      What if you could scale that instead of just the code?
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      We spend four weeks capturing how you work at your best. Not your marketing copy—the real thing. How you show up when you're in flow. What you do that clients can't articulate but keep coming back for.
    </p>

    <p class="letter-para">
      Then we build an agent that extends it. Something that could:
    </p>

    <ul class="letter-list">
      <li>Qualify leads the way you would if you had infinite time to research each one</li>
      <li>Guide customers through your product like you're there with them</li>
      <li>Help you think through new ideas with the rigor you'd apply if you weren't rushing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="letter-para">
      Not generic AI that sounds like every other chatbot. Something that feels like the best version of you.
    </p>

    <div class="letter-timeline">
      <p class="timeline-intro">Here's how the four weeks usually go:</p>

      <div class="timeline-week">
        <span class="week-label">Week 1</span>
        <p>We extract what makes you special. Through conversation, we surface the patterns you're too close to see. Why customers actually choose you. What you do that works.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-week">
        <span class="week-label">Week 2</span>
        <p>We translate it into agentic behavior. The interface, the copy, the way it thinks. This is where your instinct becomes instructions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-week">
        <span class="week-label">Week 3</span>
        <p>We make it sing. Prompts tuned, data wired up, edge cases handled. This is where good becomes great.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-week">
        <span class="week-label">Week 4</span>
        <p>You take the wheel. Test with real scenarios while we're still here. We adjust until it delivers, then hand you the keys.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="timeline-footer">
        Next sprint available <strong class="start-date">October 6th</strong>.
        By <strong class="end-date">November 3rd</strong>, you'd have something most people won't build for another year.
