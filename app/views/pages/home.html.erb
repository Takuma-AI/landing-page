          <h3>SALES</h3>
          <p><strong>How would you show up if you had infinite time to prepare for each lead?</strong> You could hack together another cold email agent this weekend. Or spend four weeks building something that wins through quality, not volume.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>PRODUCT</h3>
          <p><strong>You can't hold every customer's hand forever.</strong> But your AI could. What would most transform how people experience your product? What if every interaction felt like working with you on your best day?</p>

        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>NEW BETS</h3>
          <p><strong>AI has given you more ideas than you know what to do with.</strong> How will you build it in a way only you could? Even the best coding agent won't figure that out. Let's put fresh eyes on it.</p>

          <div class="week-number">2</div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="week-number">3</div>
