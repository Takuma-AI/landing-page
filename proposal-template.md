## Foundation Sprint: Transform how your business delivers value in 4 weeks.

We start where others can't: understanding what makes your approach unique. Through intensive collaboration, we create AI-powered experiences that scale your judgment across every customer touchpoint.

### Week 1-2: Decode Your Magic
We observe how you work, not just what you say you do. We identify the invisible patterns in your judgment that create value.

### Week 3-4: Ship the Transformation
We build and deploy AI experiences that embody your approach. Could be enhancing your existing product, creating a new touchpoint, or building an entirely different way to serve customers. We ship what scales your impact most.

### What You Get:
- **Living AI in production that feels like you at your best.**
- **Complete source code with versioned, editable prompts.**
- **Documentation written for founders, not just engineers.**

**Investment:** $10,000
**Timeline:** 4 weeks

## Strategic Guidance

Your product thinking partner, on-demand.

Sometimes you don't need a full sprint. You need someone who gets both AI possibilities and product realities. Someone who's built in this space and understands the unique challenges.

### How We Help:
- Product strategy reviews when you're at a crossroads
- AI integration patterns that maintain quality
- Design reviews that catch what others miss
- Post-sprint guidance as you build

**Investment:** $300/hour
**Structure:** Flexible, as-needed

## Who This Is For

### ✓ This is for you if:
- You're tired of sloppy AI; nothing matches your quality bar
- Your best customer testimonials mention you by name
- You can feel the difference between good and great but can't always articulate it

### ✗ This isn't for you if:
- You have a proven playbook and just need agents executing it at scale
- Your process is fully defined; you need cogs in the machine, not transformation
- You're optimizing for cost and speed over quality and differentiation
